# Dynamic Narrative Game - Game Design Document

## 1. Game Concept and Vision

### 1.1 High Concept

A first-person narrative exploration game that leverages AI to create personalized stories based on user-provided character details, workplace information, and personal backstory. Each playthrough offers a unique experience with a reactive narrator commenting on player choices.

### 1.2 Design Pillars

1. **Personalization**: Every aspect of the narrative is tailored to the player's input
2. **Meaningful Choice**: Decisions meaningfully impact story progression
3. **Meta-Commentary**: Self-aware narration that comments on player decisions
4. **Personal Resonance**: Integration of player's life details creates emotional connection
5. **Discoverability**: Hidden content rewards exploration and multiple playthroughs

### 1.3 Target Experience

Players should feel that they've entered an alternate reality version of their own life story, with familiar elements remixed into a surreal narrative that comments on choice, determinism, and personal agency. Like "The Stanley Parable," the experience shifts between humorous, philosophical, and occasionally unsettling tones.

## 2. Player Experience

### 2.1 Perspective and Controls

- First-person perspective for maximum immersion
- WASD/Arrow keys for movement
- Mouse for looking/camera control
- E or mouse click for interaction with objects
- 1-4 number keys or mouse click for dialogue choices
- Escape key for pause menu

### 2.2 Interface

- Minimalist design with no HUD during exploration
- Interaction prompts appear only when near interactive objects
- Dialogue choices appear as floating text options
- Pause menu contains:
  - Resume
  - Settings (audio, visuals, controls)
  - Save & Exit
  - Return to Main Menu

### 2.3 Game States

1. **Creation**: Player fills out character and story details
2. **Initialization**: Game generates personalized narrative structure
3. **Exploration**: Player navigates environment, discovering story elements
