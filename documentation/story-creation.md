## Step 2: Creating Your Character Profile

The details you provide will shape your entire experience. Take time to consider what information will create the most interesting story foundation.

### Character Details

#### Name

- Enter your real name or a fictional alternative
- This will be used throughout the narrative for direct address
- Consider whether you want a personal or distanced experience

#### Profession

- Current or past occupation, or an imagined career
- Be specific rather than general (e.g., "forensic accountant" rather than just "accountant")
- This profession will influence the environment and narrative themes
- The story works best with office-based or professional roles that can be adapted to the narrative structure

#### Workplace

- **Name**: Provide a company or organization name
- **Logo**: Upload an image to be integrated into the environment (optional)
- Consider fictional workplaces for more creative freedom
- The workplace will become the primary setting for your story

### Life Facts

This section creates depth and personal connection. Add multiple entries that might include:

#### Achievements

- Professional accomplishments
- Personal milestones
- Awards or recognition

- Memorable experiences
- Life-changing encounters

#### Relationships

#### Tips for Effective Life Facts

- Vary the emotional tone (achievements, challenges, surprises)
- Add specific details that make each fact distinctive
- Consider how each might be incorporated into a narrative

### Backstory

The open text field for backstory is your opportunity to establish a foundation for the narrative:

- Write 2-5 paragraphs that provide context for your character
- Explain motivations, hopes, or concerns
- Establish a situation that could lead to interesting story developments
- Consider including a minor mystery or unresolved question
- Balance realism with elements that allow for creative interpretation

#### Effective Backstory Example:

> _After fifteen years at Meridian Analytics, I've finally been promoted to Senior Data Architect. The job security is comforting, but lately I've been questioning whether this is really what I wanted from life. My office on the 27th floor offers a view of the mountains where I once dreamed of opening a photography studio. My colleagues respect me, especially after the Johnson account success, but sometimes I feel like nobody really knows me. This morning was strange - I arrived to find the office unusually quiet, with no sign of the usual Monday morning bustle..._

This example establishes:

- Professional context
- Internal conflict
